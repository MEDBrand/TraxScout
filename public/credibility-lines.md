# Traxscout Credibility Lines — Options for Med
Design: Jony | Feb 12, 2026

---

## Purpose
A single line on the landing page that answers: "Why should I trust this app to find me tracks?"
Med's 15-year LIV residency is the unfair advantage. Use it.

## Options

### Option A — Direct and confident
**"Built by a DJ with a 15-year Miami residency."**
Clean. Says everything. No name-dropping needed — the specificity ("15-year," "Miami") carries weight in the scene.

### Option B — Problem-aware
**"Built by a DJ who got tired of digging through garbage."**
Speaks directly to the pain point. Every DJ who reads this thinks "same." More relatable, less credential-flex.

### Option C — Community proof
**"Built for DJs, by a DJ who plays 200+ sets a year."**
Volume signals credibility. "200+ sets" says "this person actually needs what they built."

### Option D — Insider authority
**"The discovery tool a 15-year LIV Miami resident built for himself."**
"Built for himself" is powerful. It means the product exists because the maker needed it — not because a startup wanted to monetize DJs.

### Option E — Minimal
**"Made by a working DJ."**
Four words. Maximum restraint. Lets the product speak. Fits the Architect Era voice.

## My Recommendation
**Option D.** It combines credibility (LIV, 15 years) with authenticity ("built for himself"). It answers both "who made this?" and "why does it exist?" in one line.

## Placement
- Landing page: below the hero tagline, before the feature grid
- Font: Inter 400, 14px, #8A8A8A
- Optional: small DJ icon or headphone emoji before the text
- Do NOT put it in a badge or pill — that looks like a testimonial. This should feel like a quiet confident note.

## What NOT to do
- Don't say "MEDNAS" on the Traxscout landing page. Traxscout is a product brand. Med's personal brand is behind it but shouldn't be front and center on the product.
- Don't say "celebrity DJ" or "world-famous." Cringe. Let the specifics do the work.
- Don't add "trusted by X DJs" until you have real numbers.
